# C2F

### Introduction

For this project, you'll be creating your first full app of the term. It solves a problem, if a small one: what Fahrenheit temperature is the equivalent of a given Celsius temperature?

The math isn't all that hard for this one, nor the JavaScript. But you will be learning all about how node apps work.

Let's do this!


### Guidelines

* Although you may make extra functions if it helps, the one function asked for is an absolute requirement.


### Workflow

* You'll fork and clone this repository.
* You'll be working in `main.js`.
* For now, we'll eschew manual testing and just skip straight to manual testing. To try your app out, write `node main.js` followed by a number in the directory of your app.
* You'll know you're done when the following inputs give their respective outputs:

`node main.js 0` -> '0 degrees Celsius is 32 degrees in Fahrenheit.'
`node main.js 100` -> '100 degrees Celsius is 212 degrees in Fahrenheit.'
`node main.js 5` -> '5 degrees Celsius is 41 degrees in Fahrenheit.'


### Steps

##### 1. Call `getInput` to get the degrees in Celsius the user has typed in. See the extensive comments on how to use this pre-written helper function. Store the return value in a variable.
##### 2. Create a function for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. It should take in a number and return a number. Test it with the following inputs:

`0` -> `32`

`100` -> `212`

`5` -> `41`


##### 3. Call that function, passing in the user's input from step 1. Store the results in a variable.
##### 4. Create a message that follows the format from the Workflow output, concatenating the user's input (the Celsius temperature) and our output from the preceding step (the Fahrenheit temperature). Store that message string in a variable.
##### 5. Pass that string into `console.log`.
##### 6. Test it, as described in Workflow.
